# IoT Web Application Project Documentation

## Project Title
**IoT Data Collection and Feedback System**

## Project Overview
The IoT Web Application is designed to facilitate the interaction between IoT devices and a central server, enabling devices to upload collected data, receive feedback for future tasks, and store the data in a database. This system aims to enhance the functionality and efficiency of IoT devices by providing real-time data processing and actionable insights.

## Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Allow IoT devices to upload collected data to the server.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide feedback to IoT devices based on the collected data to inform future tasks.
- **Data Storage**: Store uploaded data securely in a database for further analysis and reporting.

## Features
1. **User Authentication**: 
   - Secure login and registration for users to access the application.
   
2. **Data Upload**: 
   - APIs for IoT devices to send data to the server (e.g., sensor readings).
   
3. **Feedback Loop**: 
   - Mechanism for the server to analyze incoming data and send appropriate feedback to the devices.
   
4. **Data Storage**: 
   - Use of a database to store uploaded data securely.
   
5. **Dashboard**:
   - User interface for monitoring device data, feedback, and historical records.
## Technical Pre-requisite
- IoT : [[Arduino]]
- Web Stack : [[MERN]]
    - **Frontend**: React.js
    - **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
    - **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (to be decided)
    - **IoT Communication Protocol**: MQTT or HTTP (to be decided)

## System Architecture
1. **IoT Devices**: 
   - Devices collect data and communicate with the server.
   
2. **Server**:
   - Handles incoming data from devices, processes it, and sends feedback.
   - Interfaces with the database to store and retrieve data.
   
3. **Database**: 
   - Stores device data and feedback for historical analysis and reporting.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - IoT devices gather relevant data (e.g., temperature, humidity) and send it to the server via a predefined API.
   
2. **Data Processing**:
   - The server processes incoming data and performs any necessary analysis or calculations.

3. **Feedback Generation**:
   - Based on the processed data, the server generates feedback and sends it back to the respective IoT device.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - The uploaded data is stored in the database for future reference and analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- **Data Visualization**: Implement charts and graphs to visualize historical data trends.
- **Alert System**: Develop an alert mechanism to notify users of critical data points or anomalies.
- **Mobile Application**: Consider creating a mobile application for easier access and monitoring.

## Conclusion
The IoT Web Application aims to bridge the communication gap between IoT devices and users, enabling efficient data collection and actionable feedback. By leveraging modern web technologies, the application will provide a scalable and user-friendly interface for managing IoT device interactions.
